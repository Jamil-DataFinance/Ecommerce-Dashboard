# Ecommerce-Dashboard

# Project Overview

This project focuses on the development and analysis of an e-commerce platform. The aim is to create a comprehensive model that captures various aspects of e-commerce operations, from sales and revenue to customer behavior and inventory management.

# Key Features

Sales performance : Monitor and analyze sales and revenue data.
Customer Behavior Analysis: Understand customer purchasing patterns and preferences.
Inventory Management: Efficiently manage stock levels and product availability


# Sales Performance 

A fundamental task was to identify and compare sales performance against targets across different territories. The analysis involved calculating the average order value, which remained consistent, indicating no improvement in overall sales. Currently, wholesale sales are nearly double those of distributor and export sales.

# Inventory Management

We need to identify items that are out of stock, low on stock, and overstocked to ensure we do not run out of in-demand products. Currently, 4 products are out of stock, and an additional 8 products are below the reorder level of 50 items. 

Additionally, card visuals should display the total number of products, which is 30, and indicate that 12 need to be reordered

# Customer Insights 

Finally, we needed to identify the top 10 customers and their value by territory. It appears that New South Wales has the highest customer value, while the Northern Territory has the lowest.

Understanding customer value distribution helps tailor marketing strategies and allocate resources more effectively.
